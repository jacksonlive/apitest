Project for ApiTesting and also develop new features. Some components will be used in production...
The logo and some images had copyright. I bought them on sites like shutterstock, be careful. About my code I dont care, its only for testing pourposes.

The technology I used: angular, sass 7-1 pattern, some basscss pieces of code, tachyions and bootstrap inspired... and so on. 

Be water my friend.
